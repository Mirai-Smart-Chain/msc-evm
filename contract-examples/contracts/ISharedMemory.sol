// ISharedMemory provides the interface for a shared memory precompile, which enables smart contracts to export UTXOs into Avalanche shared memory:
// https://github.com/ava-labs/avalanchego/blob/master/chains/atomic/README.md.
//
// This precompile provides the following functionality:
// 1. Allow a given address to export a UTXO into shared memory with an assetID derived from its address
// 2. Allow a given address to import a UTXO from shared memory when that UTXO's assetID matches the assetID derived from the caller address
// 3. Allow a caller to import an AVAX UTXO when that address is specified as the sole owner of the UTXO
// 4. Allow a caller to export an AVAX UTXO by sending AVAX through the exportAVAX function
//
// For each operation that is actually performed on shared memory, we cannot perform the operation until the block containing the action
// is accepted. Therefore, this precompile does not directly perform Put or Remove requests on shared memory, but instead emits log events
// and the details of the action that was performed.
//
// SharedMemory requires additional steps for block verification in order to ensure that atomic UTXO conflicts are handled correctly across a chain of
// processing blocks.
// Currently, atomic UTXOs are only spent by import transactions processed at the end of the block, which specify the exact UTXOs that they spend. If any
// of these transactions are invalid or include a double spend, the block is considered invalid.
// To include shared memory inside of the EVM, we need to provide a clear way to ensure that if we ever re-process a block, it observes a static state
// of shared memory, so that it can be deterministically re-executed.
// Therefore, we add the following steps to block verification prior to executing the block:
//
// 1. Iterate the EVM transactions in the block for all EVM transactions that include an import and create a set of UTXOs
// that may be imported (these transactions may contain duplicates, which will be handled within the EVM)
// 2. Verify that the full set of importUTXOs is available in the current state of shared memory
// 3. Verify that there are no conflicts with the specified importUTXOs set with the processing ancestry of the new block
// 4. Add the importedUTXO set into the BlockContext as the set of available UTXOs throughout the EVM's execution.
// 5. Add the importedUTXO set named by each transaction into its own TxContext
//
// The EVM is now responsible to ensure that any imported UTXO is available in both the BlockContext and TxContext when it is consumed
// and must handle conflicts within the block.

    // IDEA:
    // should we provide an interface that exposes the ability for a contract to export multiple tokens
    // we could include an additional assetID parameter, which would just be a number where 0 specifies
    // AVAX and then 1...n specifies additional assets that could be managed by the contract.
    // This would mean changing the getNativeTokenAssetID to take an additional parameter.
    // This wold allow us to unify the interfaces for AVAX and UTXOs.

    // getNativeTokenAssetID returns the assetID that corresponds to the specified caller.
