# Avalanche Warp Messaging

Avalanche Warp Messaging offers a basic primitive allowing Subnets including the Avalanche Primary Network to communicate with each other. Enabling Cross-Subnet communication allows applications launched on Subnets to achieve horizontal scaling to communicate seamlessly.

Avalanche Warp Messaging is a basic primitive built with the intention to allow arbitrary Custom Virtual Machines (including, but not limited to Subnet-EVM)
